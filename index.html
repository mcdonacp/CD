## Introduction
# Disability & community care

The City has developed its Access and Inclusion Plan 2023-27 (https://www.swan.wa.gov.au/awcontent/Web/Documents/CityandCouncil/Strategies%20and%20plans/City-of-Swan-Access-and-Inclusion-Plan-2023-2027.pdf) to:

- provide for universal access, and
- better support community members & groups who may be:
      - isolated
      - marginalised
      - excluded, or
      - vulnerable.

The aim is to enhance the quality of life for everyone in our community. To achieve this, there:

- are coordinated programs to improve social inclusion
- is work done with community groups & individuals to support local initiatives.

The Cities Access and Inclusion Plan 2023-27 is guided by & supports the State's Disability Strategy A Western Australia for Everyone: State Disability Strategy 2020-2030. (https://www.wa.gov.au/government/document-collections/state-disability-strategy-2020-2030)

The strategy sets the foundation for:

- building a more inclusive Western Australia, and
- empowering people with disability to participate meaningfully in all parts of society & to have the resources to do so.
